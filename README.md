Maharastra election results visualization with geopandas


Hi,everyone I am to talk about how to scrap data from internet ,create map with geopands and visualizing Maharastra 2019 election results with map.

Let's start with web Scraping
Firstly,Here we will scrap this page -"https://www.news18.com/assembly-elections-2019/maharashtra-constituency-wise-tally-live-results/" .Where you get the data of election results. scrap it.and next

And the next step to get shp files of Maharastra or India. I had shared  the folder "IND_adm" where you can get shp files of india. To get Longitudes and latitudes 
I had shared another folder "mygeodata" where you find Longitudes and Latitudes data.

Then merge the scraped data and shp file data with areas.And last with this data you can plot map

See the images I had shared you can get an idea
